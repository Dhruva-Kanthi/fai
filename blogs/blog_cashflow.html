        <p>
          What is it? Cash flow management is tracking and controlling how much money comes in and out of a business in order to accurately predict cash flow needs. 
          Businesses need people covering this aspect as businesses need to manage money exports and imports to avoid a loss of money that wasn't anticipated due to not tracking. 
          There are 3 key parts to a cash flow statement; 
          
          <ul> <br>
            <li>Cash from operating activities: cash exports and imports related directly to a business’ primary operations. </li><br>
            <li>Cash from investing activities: cash exports and imports from a company’s investments such as assets (property, equipment, etc).</li><br>
            <li>Cash from financing activities: cash exports and imports from government used to finance the company’s operations such as payment of bank loan, dividends, etc. </li><br>
          </ul><br>
          
          
          Overall, the key factor of cash flow management is creating a statement that properly lists and documents every export and import from each type of activity
           (operating, investing, financing). Doing this will greatly benefit any business or company.
