        <p class="font-bold mb-5">Introduction</p>

        <p>
          Financial literacy is the ability to understand complex financial systems 
          and decision-making processes, as well as frequently changing trends. This is
           particularly important among young adults because it provides the foundation for 
           long-term economic independence and stability.

        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">What is Financial Literacy?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          According to George Washington University, financial literacy is defined as
           "the ability to understand how money works in the world: how someone manages
            to earn or make it, how that person manages it, how he/she invests it 
            (turn it into more) and how that person donates it to help others." Financial
             literacy can also happen in two or more dimensions, i.e locking the ‘capacity
              to implement the same knowledge' by the ability to practice the capacity and
               behavioral change trigger, in this case, a global insertion of the necessary
                dynamics of human behavior (i.e action procedures for particular causes
                 affecting financial behavior). Several other important aspects of Financial
                  Literacy include Budgeting: Zero-based sum budgets apply a system to give
                   every dollar a job. They assist in financial self-regulation and expense
                    prioritization. " Inc - Debt management involves a "learning-based, 
                    self-disciplined, consistent, and intensive propensity that includes 
                    abstaining from the use of debt, paying it on schedule, making provision 
                    for the monthly and total repayment, and formulation of proper actions to
                     alleviate the monthly size and subsequent after effects of debts." <br>
                     Understanding Your Credit Score and Managing Any Debt Wise Investing 
                     including stocks, bonds etc. Financial Planning: Financial planning is 
                     establishing a short-term and long-term financial goal and designing an 
                     action plan for accomplishing it. The strategies include retirement planning,
                      tax planning, and estate planning.

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Useful Financial Literacy Tips</p>
        <p>
          Start Young: It's important to kickstart your financial life as
           soon as possible, ideally in your 20s or 30s. Begin by opening a
            checking and savings account, creating a budget, and researching
             potential investing opportunities. Utilize educational tools to
              enhance your financial literacy, such as books, webinars, and
               workshops available on websites like Investopedia, Khan Academy,
                and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These resources 
                will help ensure you're getting started on the right track and 
                contribute to your overall financial knowledge. <br>
                Manage Your Budget: Use budgeting applications like Mint,
                 You Need a Budget (YNAB), or Personal Capital to manage your 
                 finances and track your expenses. These tools are available 
                 for free and help you stay on top of your spending habits,
                  enabling you to find areas to cut back on. <br>
                  Emergency Fund: Aim to have 3–6 months of living expenses
                   in an emergency fund to cover unexpected events. This fund provides
                    financial security against unpredictable large expenses, sudden medical
                     issues, or job losses. Avoid high-interest debt, such as credit card debt,
                      which can quickly spiral out of control. Pay off your credit card balance 
                      in full every month to prevent any interest. If you have existing debt, 
                      prioritize paying it off as soon as possible. <br>
                      Investments: Start investing in your 20s to save for the future. 
                      Use retirement accounts like a 401(k) or IRA and contribute regularly. 
                      Diversify your investments across multiple industries to spread the risk 
                      and increase potential returns. <br>
                      Seek Professional Advice: If you're uncertain about your financial choices,
                       consulting a certified financial planner can provide valuable insight.
                        The right advisor will help clarify your financial situation and create
                         a detailed plan for success. During the first session, expect to ask many
                          questions and work with your advisor to develop a step-by-step plan based
                           on your goals and financial situation.

        </p>
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        <p>
          Financial literacy takes practice and lifelong learning. 
          Young adults who can understand key financial concepts and implement
           proactive strategies from an early age will have a better chance of 
           achieving financial independence. The goal, then, must be harmony in 
           making wise financial decisions that support your values and goals.
