    <p>
      The conflict between Israel and Iran has been making headlines, but beyond the political and humanitarian aspects, it also carries major financial consequences that impact everyday people and investors alike.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Whenever conflict erupts in oil-producing regions, global markets tend to react quickly. One of the first things we see is a surge in oil prices due to fears about disrupted supply chains. This rise in oil prices can lead to higher gas and transportation costs, which in turn increases the price of many goods we rely on. That’s inflation in action.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      These kinds of geopolitical events also influence investor behavior. When uncertainty grows, investors often pull money out of risky assets like tech stocks and put it into “safe haven” investments such as gold or government bonds. At the same time, defense industry stocks and oil companies may experience a boost as demand for security and energy spikes.
    </p><br>

    <p>
      Understanding how global events shape financial markets can help young people become smarter about saving, spending, and investing. You don’t need to be a Wall Street expert to know that international news can affect your wallet.

      <li>After recent missile launches, oil prices spiked nearly 12% in one week.</li><br>
      <li>Gold prices and U.S. Treasury bond demand also increased as investors looked for safety.</li><br>
      <li>Defense companies saw an uptick in stock value due to anticipated military spending.</li><br>
