        <p>
          How do you evaluate the investability of a company? In the 20th century, most investors were speculative, with some 
          conducting analysis that only looked at the company’s financials, the actions that the company was taking, and the 
          current trends of the market. Today, this scope has expanded to analyze how a company also addresses ESG (environmental,
          social, and governance) factors through their operations as the marketplace is valuing sustainability and the actions 
          a company is taking towards sustainability much greater now. In fact, to help investors in this analysis, agencies 
          score companies on their exposure to these 3 factors. (This system is somewhat flawed, and I actually wrote a research 
          paper about this, which can be found <a href="https://www.scitepress.org/publishedPapers/2024/127257/pdf/index.html">here</a>). 
          In this Founder’s Thought, we will investigate the evolution of ESG Risk Scores.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Past</p>
        
        <p>
          Initially, ESG Risk scoring started in the early 2000s as investors sought innovative paths to evaluate a 
          company’s non-financial risk. However, this system found many preliminary obstacles. Firstly, the assessments, 
          which were focused on environmental, social, and governance risk factors were truly focused on environmental 
          factors and fundamental governance factors. Secondly, since the concept of ESG Risk scoring was recently developed, 
          most companies did not publicly release the information needed for investors to understand its non-financial risk 
          and agencies to effectively score companies, which led to an inconsistent scoring system between these agencies.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Present</p>
        <p>
          Today’s ESG risk scoring has advanced to include various specific factors across environmental, social, and 
          governance areas, such as greenhouse gas emissions, diversity within the company, and business ethics. It 
          has also evolved to add a layer of nuance and sophistication, accounting for industry-specific natural risks, 
          such as the energy sector’s proneness to environmental risk. Furthermore, scores are now mostly quantitative-based 
          rather than qualitative assessments as they focus more on numerical data, even utilizing AI-powered approaches. 
          These changes have led to the widespread adoption of ESG risk scores as investors can trust them to a greater degree 
          and use them to make decisions.
        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Future</p>
        <p>
          Although it is difficult to predict the future, some current gaps in ESG Risk scoring will likely be filled. The 
          largest issue in ESG Risk scoring today is the need for more standardization as ESG Risk scoring agencies, such as 
          MSCI and Sustainalytics, look at different factors (scope) and assign these various factors a different weight when 
          calculating ESG Risk scores. (You can find more information about this variance in MIT’s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rof/article/26/6/1315/6590670">Aggregate Confusion research paper</a>). 
          Furthermore, we are seeing greenwashing, where many companies act like they are truly committed to certain causes by 
          investing money in them, yet there are no tangible benefits. Thus, in the future, we should analyze the effects of 
          actions rather than measure the actions. Finally, as the world moves further towards technology and AI, it would be 
          beneficial to integrate these new technologies and seek real-time scoring, similar to the rapid changes in the stock market. 
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
          Overall, ESG Risk scoring has done a tremendous job thus far in helping us understand and analyze companies 
          from a non-financial perspective. Their role also indirectly pushes companies to take sustainable actions, and 
          their role in providing information to investors helps support the growing field of impact investing. It will be 
          interesting to see how ESG Risk scoring plays out in the future.
