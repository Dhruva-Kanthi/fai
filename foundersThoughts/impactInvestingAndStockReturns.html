        <p class="font-bold mb-5">Impact Investing: Achieving Both Financial Returns and Social Impact</p>

        <p>
          For many investors, simply making returns on their investments to be profitable is already quite a difficult task, 
          so it’s only logical to assume that trying to achieve sustainable impact on top of that is nearly impossible. However,
          it is possible to achieve both financial returns and sustainable impact. In fact, for longer term investing, many argue 
          that the 2 are somewhat associated; thus, investing for sustainable impact may result in financial results. In this 
          Founder’s Thought, we will explore common myths of “Sacrificed Returns” and how to invest for sustainable impact or 
          conduct impact investing.

        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Debunking Myths</p>
        
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, a common assumption is that impact investing, which looks to achieve sustainable impact through
          investment, often results in investors being forced to accept lower financial returns. In fact, many critics argue 
          that prioritizing a cause through impact investing might come at the expense of the profitability of the investment. 
          However, studies challenge this assumption, arguing that impact investing can be extremely profitable. In fact, a 
          2020 <a href="https://thegiin.org/publication/research/impinv-survey-2020/">study conducted by the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN)</a> argues that most impact investors reported financial 
          performance similar to that of non-impact investors, which challenges the assumption that impact investing sacrifices returns. 
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Strategies for Dual Success</p>
        <p>
          To achieve success in both, achieving sustainable impact and maximizing returns when investing, the most important 
          step is to clearly identify your goals. By identifying your goals or specific causes you want to support, such as 
          clean energy, women empowerment, and racial diversity, you can start to analyze companies in a lens that will reflect 
          both their financial viability and their ability to uplift your causes. This lens is the foundation for impact investing.
          Since companies are traditionally evaluated for their financial viability, adding another lens of analysis can be difficult. 
          However, there are multiple tools that can be used to understand how a company is moving towards sustainable impact. 
          The easiest to use are ESG Risk scores although they do have their pros and cons as discussed in a previous Founder 
          Thought, titled <b><i>“Impact Investing: Evolution of Environmental, Social and Governance scores”</i></b>. ESG Risk scores can 
          help provide investors with a surface-level idea of how a company is moving towards sustainability. However, to dig 
          deeper, I would recommend investigating a company’s annual report and sustainability report amongst other publicly 
          released information on a company’s actions.

        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
          Overall, impact investing seems too good to be true. You can experience strong financial returns without sacrificing
          your ability to make a sustainable impact on the world through your investment. Yet, getting the hang of impact 
          investing can be challenging; thus, it is important to change your perspective when analyzing companies to make it 
          easier to identify opportunities for dual success.
