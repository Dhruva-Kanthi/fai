        <p>
          With the debate of the value of a college education, financially, circulating, many fail to consider one of the most 
          important variables: the career path. In a previous Founder’s Thought, titled “College: Is college education worth 
          the time and money?”, we mentioned that a college degree opens up the door for incredible opportunities in the 
          future, namely, high-paying jobs, but in today’s Founder’s Thought, we will dig deeper and analyze the specifics 
          between 3 major career paths that a college education paves the way for.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">STEM Careers</p>
        
        <p>
          STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics focused on a cluster of career paths in which 
          students explore the world of innovation and go through a difficult 4-years in college to land a high paying jobs. 
          STEM careers boast some of the toughest courses in college, including advanced, computing, mathematics, and physics 
          courses. However, the perseverance pays off as STEM majors make nearly $7k more out-of-college than non-STEM majors 
          out-of-college. However, the STEM industry is becoming increasingly saturated as more people are getting STEM degrees,
          making it harder for STEM students to land jobs out of college. However, for the majority of STEM majors who work 
          hard during and after college, their career will thank them for their college degree as the financial burden will 
          barely be felt considering their high-paying job.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Finance Careers</p>
        <p>
          Another lucrative and growing industry are finance careers. Unlike STEM careers, those seeking finance careers 
          out-of-college will not have to go through incredibly tedious courses through college although their courses 
          are still of great difficulty depending on the program. Yet, finance careers, specifically investment banking 
          is well-known for its monstrous salaries out-of-college up to $180k. Although, it is important to note the 
          difficulty of breaking into investment banking and investment banking. Yet, even those who were unsuccessful 
          in breaking into investment banking can still make well over the median salary working jobs in accounting and 
          sales and trading.
        </p>
   
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
          Although STEM and Finance careers provide a strong rationale for students interested in such careers to attend 
          college, there are various other careers, namely healthcare, that can offer students similar benefits. Furthermore, 
          many see great value in college when exploring interdisciplinary areas that allow students to broaden their 
          perspectives and connect the dots past standard lines. Overall, it is important to conduct a personal analysis 
          to determine whether college will be beneficial for your intended to career path.
