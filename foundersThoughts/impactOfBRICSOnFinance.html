        <p>
          The United States has dominated the global scene politically and economically since the end of the Second World War. However, it has had strong 
          rivals, namely the Soviet Union, Russia, and China. However, the economic and political worlds still revolve around the United States. Yet, 
          emerging countries are gaining more and more influence economically, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, forming BRICS. In 
          today’s founders' thoughts, we will explore the impact of BRICS on financial markets.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Historical Market Performance</p>
        
        <p>
          Historically, financial markets follow a similar pattern every 4 years. They start by becoming volatile because of the uncertainty 
          associated with electing a new president in the months leading up to the election. Then, once a president is chosen, the market 
          rallies because a decision has been made, and it is a little easier to predict what the future will hold. However, the market generally 
          rallies higher if the elected president is in the same party as the Incumbent, as this signals stability and control for the American 
          people. Finally, specific sectors may perform differently depending on the policy agenda of the elected president. For example, the 
          oil and natural gas industries are likely to perform well if a Republican is elected and drop if a Democrat is elected because 
          Republicans continue to support the harvesting of fossil fuels.

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Key Factors Influencing Markets</p>
        <p>
          With changes in administration, policy shifts arise as change is needed to address people’s needs. Many of these policies, including 
          tax changes, healthcare reforms, and trade agreements, can significantly change the outlook for certain companies. For example, 
          shifts in trade agreements could directly affect companies that target international customers or are dependent on global resources. 
          Different administrations also take different approaches to regulations in specific industries, such as pharmaceuticals, which could 
          directly impact certain companies. Finally, each political party has a different approach to the economy, which may sway investor’s 
          confidence in markets. For example, Democrats are known for heavy government spending, while Republicans are known for cutting taxes.

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Investor Strategies</p>
        <p>
          Acknowledging that elections will bring volatility in markets in the months preceding them, investors can prepare by diversifying their 
          portfolios to hedge against possible risk. Ultimately, it would benefit investors to analyze and predict the portions of the market that 
          may benefit or suffer with the changes of administrations and act accordingly through trades.
