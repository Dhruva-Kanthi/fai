        <p class="font-bold mb-5">Inflation: Effect of Inflation on Small Businesses</p>

        <p>
            In today’s Founder’s Thought, we will explore ideas discussed in the previous two Founder’s 
                      Thoughts, titled “Inflation: Effect of Inflation on Interest Rates” and “Inflation: 
                      Effect of Inflation on Poverty”. To be more specific, we will explore how the effects 
                      of rising interests and decreasing purchasing power can affect the financial condition 
                      of small businesses and affect their decision-making
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Rising Costs</p>
        
        <p>
            By definition, inflation brings a rise in costs to a small business. However, unlike mega corporations,
          small businesses do not have the leverage or the resources to fight these rising costs or find a sustainable, 
          alternative producer with the same quality as their original. Thus, small businesses experience thinning 
          profit margins along with a hostile competitive environment as their large competitors have an advantage 
          and their smaller competitors are just as desperate as they are for some financial breathing room.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Pricing Adjustments</p>
        <p>
            Like any good business does, most small businesses adapt to external factors. Here, small businesses 
          are forced to make pricing adjustments and decide whether they want to charge higher prices and maintain 
          their margins while possibly shooing off customers or tanking the lower margins to maintain their customer
          base. Yet, both options are compromised positions. The only difference is that charging higher prices 
          leads to a positive feedback loop that exaggerates inflation.

        </p>

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Effect On Community</p>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, both options to adapt to the rising costs are compromised, especially when 
          analyzing their effect on the community. For example, if a corner store were to increase its prices, 
          it would be difficult for the supporting population to match these price increases to 
          keep the business afloat. Regardless, this creates a gash in the pockets of the community. On the other 
          side, if the corner store were to keep its prices the same, the rising raw material cost would force 
          the corner store to streamline its resources, namely employment, resulting in the loss of jobs that 
          belong to the community.

        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, inflation leads to difficult decisions for small business owners, both of which are destined 
          to result in some sort of financial loss for the business and the community. Small 
          business owners also experience greater difficulty in terms of access to capital as the rising interest 
          rates make it difficult for them to borrow sustainably.
