        <p>
          A huge focus of impact investing is diversity, equity, and inclusion. These factors measure how a company is working 
          to socially enhance the community around them as well as supporting social groups within their company. DEI 
          (diversity, equity, and inclusion) has evolved incredibly over the past 60 years, and in this Founderâ€™s Thought, we 
          will take a look at its incredible change over time.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Past</p>
        
        <p>
          DEI was initially sparked by the civil rights movement, in which social groups, namely African-Americans, fought 
          for inclusion and equality in society. Thus, the initial forms of DEI came through affirmative action, which aimed 
          to increase representation of underrepresented groups in education and employment. In the workplace, the equal 
          establishment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1965 represented a shift towards anti-discrimination 
          in the corporate world. 
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Present</p>
        <p>
          Today, DEI has been placed under a magnifying glass as its scope has expanded to include race, gender, sexual 
          orientation, disability, age, and more. In fact, many businesses now have entire departments focused on DEI in 
          the workplace to ensure that each employee feels welcomed and included, so that they can thrive. The need for DEI 
          has also been emphasized as it provides corporations with a new perspective in conversations that can shift corporate 
          sentiment and provide new analysis.
        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Future</p>
        <p>
          Today, we are already seeing the effects of technology and AI, so we can only imagine its impact on businesses and 
          corporations in the future. Yet, I imagine that in a world ruled by monotonous thought, DEI will become more important
          as it will largely be the difference maker in the business world. Neurodiversity will likely become a key evaluator 
          for job applicants for many companies. 
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
          Overall, the evolution of diversity, equity, and inclusion is remarkable, and it is clear from current trends that it is 
          not going away in the foreseeable future. As DEI continues to grow, so will impact investing.
