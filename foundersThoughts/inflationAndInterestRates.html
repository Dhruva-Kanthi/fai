        <p class="font-bold mb-5">Inflation: Effect of Inflation on Interest Rates</p>

        <p>
            “We are looking for a house, but the interest rates are around 7%, while our friends who 
                      settled a couple of years earlier have 3% mortgages on their houses,” I remember having 
                      this conversation a few days ago when I attempted to connect with my uncle, who had just 
                      moved to Frisco. Despite a household income above $250k, the latest hikes in interest 
                      rates are currently wreaking havoc on households, and the culprit of these hikes is none 
                      other than our good friend: inflation.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Relationship between Inflation and Interest Rates</p>
        
        <p>
            With the recent geopolitical conflict and unprecedented amount of federal spending, it’s no surprise 
          that inflation has risen. To counter this rise in inflation, the “Fed” or the Federal Reserve System, 
          which serves as the central banking system in the United States, has been slowly raising the federal 
          funds rate, which is the interest rate at which established banks can borrow from the government. Interest 
          rates attack inflation because they discourage spending as the cost of debt increases; thus, people are 
          less likely to borrow money. As people slow down the borrowing of money, they stop spending it as quickly,
          resulting in a drop in demand for products, reducing the rate at which prices increase.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Historical Examples</p>
        <p>
            One of the most significant examples of the use of interest rates by central banks to control inflation 
          occurred under Paul Volcker’s tenure as Federal Reserve chairman. During the 1970s, as a result of the 
          Cold War, inflation was consistently flying high, giving it the name “The Great Inflation”; thus, Volcker 
          aggressively tightened monetary policy throughout this period to successfully bring inflation down from 
          over 11% to under 5% with the federal funds rate peaking at 20% during the month of June in 1981. Yet, 
          the consequence of such harsh monetary policy caused a severe recession during this period.

        </p>
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
            When people discuss the harmful effects of inflation, they normally only talk about its direct 
          effects, namely through rising prices; however, as we’ve explored throughout this Founder’s Thought, 
          inflation can have incredibly harmful indirect effects as well since it can reduce the financial 
          freedom of citizens through high interest rates.
