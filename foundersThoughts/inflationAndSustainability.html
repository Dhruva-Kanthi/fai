        <p>
            In today’s Founder’s Thought, we will take a unique angle when exploring the effects of 
                      inflation as we examine how they affect recent trends toward sustainability. The sustainability 
                      movement is ballooning in popularity as the public becomes more aware of the threats that 
                      humanity faces, especially environmentally; however, the sustainability movement has truly 
                      picked up steam in the world of finance as impact investing is becoming more and more popular.
                      In today’s Founder’s Thought, we will look at the effect inflation’s rising prices have on 
                      the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Cost of Sustainable Goods</p>
        
        <p>
            Sustainable goods are naturally more expensive than typical goods. This can easily be seen in supermarkets, 
          where organic groceries sell for up to 20% higher than their non-organic counterparts. This is mainly because 
          the unsustainable infrastructure is much more thoroughly developed than those used for sustainable processes. 
          Thus, this underdeveloped infrastructure is put under greater stress and difficult decisions (similar to small 
          businesses discussed in our previous Founder’s Thought, “Inflation: Effect of Inflation on Small Businesses”). 
          Thus, similar to small businesses, these infrastructures are forced to choose between smaller margins and 
          higher costs, most of whom prefer the latter. This makes existing sustainable goods more expensive and out
          of reach for the everyday consumer, hindering sustainability.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Investment in Green Technologies</p>
        <p>
            Once again, similar to the rising cost of sustainable goods associated with inflation, green technologies 
          become less profitable with inflation compared to their unsustainable counterparts. For example, oil 
          companies have historically been more successful than solar/wind power/hydropower companies during times 
          of rising costs associated with inflation. This lack of financial success makes it difficult for investors 
          to stick with their impact investing methodologies, making it more difficult to support the sustainability 
          movement.

        </p>

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
            Overall, the adverse effects of inflation on the general economy can not be overstated, but it's 
          mind-boggling to observe the difference in adaptability between green components of our society, such as
          goods and companies, and their unsustainable counterparts.
