        <p>
          With the world still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia took the world by surprise as it invaded its little 
          brother, Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine have had a detailed history throughout and after the era of the Soviet Union, 
          with Russia even invading Crimea, Ukraine’s southeast peninsula, in 2014. The consequences of Russia’s actions were 
          felt worldwide, especially financially. In this founder’s thought, we will explore the impact of the geopolitical 
          conflict between Russia and Ukraine on financial markets.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Immediate Market Reactions</p>
        
        <p>
          Immediately after the invasion announcement, stock exchanges experienced volatility and uncertainty, similar to the 
          sentiments of the investors, who were uncertain of the future. Overall, the markets experienced an adverse reaction 
          as many anticipated routine war impacts to occur again as news broke out of the conflict overseas. Another immediate 
          reaction was the soaring of commodity prices as many were able to quickly anticipate issues related to oil supply as 
          Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter, would likely be sanctioned, as is usually the case for the aggressors. 
          Finally, with many predicted political and economic instability around the corner, currencies fluctuated as the Russian 
          ruble and Ukrainian Hryvnia fell with predicted instability, and the US Dollar and Swiss francs rose as investors sought
          a stable currency.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Long-term Consequences</p>
        <p>
          Although the world experienced panic immediately following the invasion, most of it subsided; however, Ukraine and 
          Russia continued to suffer as they were engaged in conflict. Furthermore, Russia experienced severe financial 
          difficulty as it received economic sanctions from Western powers. These sanctions have cast out Russia from the 
          majority of global trade. Thus, many countries that previously relied on Russia, such as European nations, for 
          energy were forced to explore alternative suppliers, such as nations in the Middle East. Finally, the global supply 
          chain experienced disruptions as Russia is one of the largest exporters of metals. Furthermore, the supply chain 
          disruptions paired with energy shortages led to inflationary pressures worldwide as the supply of these materials 
          decreased.

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Investment Strategies and Opportunities</p>
        <p>
          With new economic movements resulting from the geopolitical climate, investors shift their portfolios directly, 
          with many investors looking at sectors that are likely to benefit from the latest climate, such as energy, defense, 
          and commodities. Furthermore, many investors have become much more weary of international investment as those who 
          invested in Russia could not liquidate their assets, resulting in losses. Finally, investors started to shift towards 
          investments that have the potential to positively impact society and the environment, looking at ESG scores. 
          For example, with the shortages that resulted from attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, there was a shift toward 
          investing in renewable energy sources that could serve as an alternative to natural gas.
