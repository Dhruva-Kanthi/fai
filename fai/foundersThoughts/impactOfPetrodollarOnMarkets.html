        <p>
          The United States is the most powerful country in the world, and a key reason is its economic dominance and control over international trade. 
Furthermore, the United States was able to establish its dominance over international trade through a strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia and the 
creation of the Petrodollar. In today’s founder’s thought, we will examine the effect of the petrodollar on financial markets.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">The Role of Petrodollar in Global Trade</p>
        
        <p>
          In 1973, the United States reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia, where Saudi Arabia, a growing oil powerhouse, would price its oil in US 
          Dollars in exchange for military protection and economic cooperation. Pricing oil in US Dollars forces every country to hold a reserve of 
          US Dollars since they will need oil to keep their country afloat. Furthermore, this also leads oil exporting countries, namely those in OPEC 
          (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), to develop large reserves of US Dollars. Thus, since all countries need US dollars, the 
          United States can possess such a large spending deficit that their currency will not be devalued as every country needs petrodollars.


        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Market Implications and Trends</p>
        <p>
          The constant demand for US Dollars for oil purchasing strengthens the US Dollar against other currencies as well as the US economy. This 
          currency dynamic leads the United States economy to stay in a relatively stable state of growth while other countries have to manage their 
          currencies and inflation to a greater degree. Touching back on the OPEC nations that develop large reserves of US Dollars, many of them tend 
          to invest in US-based assets, which further strengthens the United States economy as it receives advantages that no other country’s economy 
          receives. This international investment into the United States economy helps support the United States in its spending deficit while also 
          supporting liquidity in the US financial markets and increased investment into large corporations.


        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Future of the Petrodollar System</p>
        <p>
          The Petrodollar system is clearly a biased system, favoring the United States both politically and economically. Thus, many are calling for 
          changes to the system such as the use of additional currencies, such as the Great Britain Pound or Chinese Yuan. Others call for exploring 
          decentralized currencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The collapse of the Petrodollar system could be disastrous for the United States as 
          it will lose its edge in the current global landscape. Nonetheless, only time will tell.
