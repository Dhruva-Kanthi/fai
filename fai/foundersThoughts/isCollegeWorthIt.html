        <p class="font-bold lg:text-3xl text-2xl mb-5">College: Is college education worth the time and money?</p>

        <p>
          Recently, debate has sparked on whether or not a college education is worth the time and money as more college graduates
          are having difficulties securing a job after college. This is an incredibly nuanced topic, considering the variety of 
          options in experiencing college and the current job market. In this article, we will investigate the value of a college 
          education and provide you with some sort of guidance in making this decision.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Opportunities with a College Education</p>
        
        <p>
          College education has a reputation for opening the door to so many opportunities for graduates. In fact, today, 
          most high-paying jobs require a 4-year degree. However, many argue that the “inflation” in the number of people 
          with a college degree has decreased the value of each degree. Furthermore, they argue that even with a 4-year degree, 
          they aren’t able to land their desired job because of the level of competition. Regardless, earning a 4-year degree 
          makes people eligible for most jobs.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Financial Obligation</p>
        <p>
          Despite the incredible boost that a college education provides to most people’s careers, the massive cost of attending 
          is a concern, not to mention the student loan debt that they could lead to. With the cost of attending some private 
          institutions exceeding $80k without aid, it is important to look at the financial aspect of attending college 
          (We looked at how to financially prepare for college in one of our previous articles, titled "Investing Strategies 
          for Teens and Young Adults: College”). However, today, most schools offer incredible financial aid packages depending 
          on your family’s capacity to pay for the education. Similarly, attending a public, in-state university is another 
          excellent way to save money and maximize the financial return of your investment into college. Either way, depending 
          on the major, college graduates will be able to pay for their education with their job that were most likely unable to 
          get without college.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Intellectual Enrichment</p>
        <p>
          Thus far, we have discussed the financial and career aspects of attending college. Still, a college education 
          also offers incredible intellectual enrichment to its students, as they are exposed to many bright minds and 
          introduced to various concepts across many subjects. College life also prepares students for adulthood, as many 
          live without their parents for the first time and must learn to become independent to thrive.
        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
          Overall, it is difficult to overestimate the value of college as most receive career boosts, new opportunities, 
          and intellectual enrichment because of their college education. Despite the hefty financial obligation, today, 
          many diverse and effective ways exist to pay for college. Thus, for most individuals, the pros of a college 
          education outweigh the cons.
