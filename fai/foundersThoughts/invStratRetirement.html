        <p>
          Retirement is a stage of life that most people look forward to: no work stress, freedom of time, and peace of mind. 
          However, according to a 2023 Gallup poll, only 43% of non-retired adults expect to be financially comfortable in 
          retirement. Yet, this number is expected to worsen, considering millennials' spending habits and, soon, Gen-Z. 
          Despite the financial indiscipline of the younger generation, there are ways to prepare for retirement financially.

        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">401(k)</p>
        
        <p>
          A 401(k) is a retirement account that is offered by employers to their employees, where employees can allot a 
          certain amount of their paycheck towards the account, which they will not be able to access without a penalty 
          until the age of 59 and ½ years. 401(k) accounts are unique because many employers will offer a matching contribution, 
          essentially “free money” for your retirement. You can then use the money inside the 401(k) account to invest 
          in various investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">IRA</p>
        <p>
            IRAs are Individual Retirement accounts that are set up by an individual through a financial institution, 
          usually a bank. Like 401(k) accounts, IRAs offer users the ability to invest the money inside the account into 
          various investments, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. However, it is important to note that IRAs offer 
          a greater variety of investments than 401(k) accounts, but the contribution limit for users is less than that of 
          401(k) accounts.

        </p>

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Roth vs. Normal</p>
        <p>
          For IRAs and 401(k) accounts, an extra layer of complexity is added with the availability of “Roth” accounts. 
          Traditionally, users’ contributions to their retirement accounts are tax-deferred, meaning that tax will be applied 
          to the money in the account once money is taken out of the account, whereas “Roth” accounts tax the users’ contribution 
          while leaving withdrawals tax-free. Although tax deferral is the main difference, it is important to research each 
          of the accounts and their features before making a decision.
        </p>
    
        <p class="font-bold my-5">Conclusion</p>
        
        <p>
            Before making a decision, it is important to consult a financial planner who can give you an idea of which 
          account will be best for you. Regardless of the retirement account you choose, it is important to start contributing 
          early because the compounding effect of returns is incredibly powerful and painful to miss.
