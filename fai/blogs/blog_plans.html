        <p class="font-bold mb-5">Guest Lecture Overview</p>

        <p>
          FAI has teamed up with many professionals within the finance and business field to host guest lectures for FAI members to join and learn more about finance. These guest speakers will help create more profound insight into the proper field of business and finance while creating interest in why the field is so important!
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Our First Guest Lecture</p>
        
        <p>
          Recently, Charles Goldberg, the COO of FAI, and Siddha Kanthi, the organizationâ€™s CEO, interviewed Blake Siewart, the North American Head of Growth and Innovation at Siemens Healthineers, where they discussed the ideas of building value within a business in his presentation, <em>Value Squared.</em>
          This guest lecture is the first of many to come as we have lined up many other professionals to interview, such as Mr. Winston Black, founder and former CEO of SWK Holdings, and Mr. Matt Anderson, senior VP at Wells Fargo Private Bank. 
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">The Goal with Guest Lectures</p>
        <p>
            This guest lecture is the first of many to come as we have lined up many other professionals to interview, such as Mr. Winston Black, founder and former CEO of SWK Holdings, and Mr. Matt Anderson, senior VP at Wells Fargo Private Bank.
        
            With these guest lectures, FAI members will gain more knowledge about financial literacy. We aspire that these lectures will create more interest in finance and that members can utilize strategies discussed in these lectures to achieve their financial goals.

        </p>

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Our other plans</p>
        <p>
          In addition to these guest lectures, FAI has begun planning in-person events and collaborating with many successful business executives, entrepreneurs, professors, and others. These resources will expand the knowledge of finance and inspire many!
          More information about upcoming guest lectures and events will be sent out soon, as we hope for more FAI members to join and learn more!
